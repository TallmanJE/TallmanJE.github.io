							<h2>Podcast</h2>
							<p>In this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-807071181/finalpodcast-horoscopehunters-copy3">podcast</a> we interview a beginner, an intermidiate astrologist, and a couple who are experts on the subject. Through asking them questions about their relationships with the stars we learned that astrology can impact your life on any level.</p>

							<h2>Video</h2>
							<p>Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgWRKupBs0M&feature=youtu.be">video</a> maps the star chart of celebrity Kim Kardashian. Using gems we highlight the qualities of her birth chart in relation to her life. As a group, we thought it would teach others how to read their birthcharts. Also, we hoped it could serve as a tool for others to get more in-tune with themselves.</p>

							<h2>Newsletters</h2>
							<p>Throughout the semster I wrote three newsletters. The first newsletter, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/horoscopehunters/letters/astronomy-vs-astrology-place-your-bets">Astronomy vs Astrology...Place Your Bets</a>, dives into the differences between the science and the concept of astrology. The second newsletter, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/horoscopehunters/letters/wait-what-s-my-sign">Wait...What's My Sign?</a>, explores the shift in astrological charts with the inclusion of a sign that was abandoned thousands of years ago. The final newsletter, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/horoscopehunters/letters/stars-for-sale-what-not-to-fall-for-in-the-astrology-business">Stars For Sale- What Not To Fall For in The Astrology Business</a>, is a Dos and Don'ts guide for those exploring astrology. Other newsletters from my group are linked below. </p>
